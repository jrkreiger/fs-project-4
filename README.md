# Flatiron School Project 4
## Machine Learning for Natural Resource Management


### Description
This repository contains files from a project assigned to me as part of Flatiron School's Online Data Science Bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate skills in machine learning.

Here's what you'll find inside:
- **kreiger-fs-project-4.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing project code
- **kreiger-fs-project-4.html**: the above Jupyter Notebook but in HTML, so you can more easily view it in your browser
- **presentation.pdf**: PDF file containing slides from a non-technical presentation of project results

### Technical specifications
The dependencies for the notebook are: Python 3.7.3, Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Itertools, Pickle, Collections, Imbalanced-Learn, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost.

Because some of the models would have taken very long to run on my local machine, I did most of the modeling in Google Colab using a GPU runtime. If you decide to run the notebook on your own machine, even with a GPU, be advised that some of the models may take over an hour to run. In addition, the pickled models can be pretty large (>300MB), so if memory is an issue, you may want to skip over those cells.

### Authorship
The dataset for this project was published by Jock A. Blackard in 1998, and although it is free to reuse, Blackard and Colorado State University retain the copyright. You can find a description of the dataset here: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/covertype/covertype.data.html. The dataset itself is available at the last link on this page: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/covertype/. This dataset was also the subject of a Kaggle competition, which you can view here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction/overview.

I wrote the code in the Jupyter Notebook, the text of this README, my blog post linked above, and the content of my non-technical presentation.
